# Portal Design for Noise Pollution Monitoring System

This project is designed to monitor the Noise generated from the different Blocks of the District.
We are assuming that the IoT devices are installed at each Blocks of the Districts and from those devices we are getting the data and those data are stored in our centralized database.

## Required Software
* XAMPP must be installed in your system.

## For Database
* Download the 'noiseapp.sql' file and then import that file. 

### How to import 'noiseapp.sql' file
- Start the Apache and MySQL serverices of XAMPP.
- Open your browser, then type 'localhost/phpmyadmin'
- Create a new database named 'noiseapp'
- Then click on 'Import' tab.
- Then choose the sql file that you have downloaded, scroll down a bit.
- Then click on 'GO' button.
- Now you would see the all the tables going to show under the database name.


Now you are ready. Have fun.

## Thank You
